# Day 5

[Working file](files/Choco_sales.ipynb)

Today was a bit of a slow day as it was Sunday, but managed to have a look through the ARIMA / SARIMA / SARIMAX

To explore the above, will be using sample daily chocolate sales 

1. Usual data loading and EDA
2. Did some AMIRA / SAMIRA / SAMIRAX analysis. INitially thought of using pmdamira but saw it has not been updated in about 2 years so gave that one a pass and used statsforecast instead - took a while to install and get right as there were a few compatability issues.
